minicoredumper
==============

Overview
--------

    minicoredumper provides an alternate core dump facility for Linux
    to allow minimal and customized crash dumps. It is composed
    primarily of 3 parts:

      1. minicoredumper - a customizable core dump application to replace
                          the default Linux core dump facility

      2. libminicoredumper - a library allowing applications to register
                             data for dumping

      3. minicoredumper_dbusd - a D-Bus service to allow multiple
                                applications to dump their data if any
                                of the applications crash or on demand

      $ make
      $ sudo make install

    In the "etc" directory there are sample configuration and D-Bus
    permission files.

    To inform Linux to use the minicoredumper for the core dump facility:

      $ echo '|/usr/bin/minicoredumper %p %u %g %s %t %h %e' | \
             sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

Demo
----

    This packages provides an example application to test the
    minicoredumper. The example application is not build by default.
    This must be activated with the --with-minicoredumper_demo
    argument for configure.

    The example application minicoredumper_demo uses libminicoredumper
    to register variables and then crashes. This should trigger the
    minicoredumper. The example also registers with minicoredumper_dbusd
    via D-Bus. When another application crashes, the example application
    will respond by dumping its data as well.

    Assuming minicoredumper is installed and activated, D-Bus is
    installed, and minicoredumper_dbusd is running, the demo can be
    executed with the following commands:

      $ minicoredumper_demo 6 & sleep 3 && minicoredumper_demo

    This will start one instance of minicoredumper_demo in the background
    that will gracefully exit after 6 seconds. After waiting 3 seconds,
    it also starts another instance of minicoredumper_demo in the
    foreground that will crash immediately.

    In the minicoredumper base_dir there should now be a directory
    containing the dump data from the second (crashed) instance of
    minicoredumper_demo. In that directory there should also be a
    subdirectory "dumps-NNN" containing the dump data from the first
    instance of minicoredumper_demo (that had a graceful exit).
