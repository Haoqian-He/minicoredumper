minicoredumper
==============

Overview
--------

    minicoredumper provides an alternate core dump facility for Linux
    to allow minimal and customized crash dumps. It is composed
    primarily of 3 parts:

      1. minicoredumper - a customizable core dump application to replace
                          the default Linux core dump facility

      2. libminicoredumper - a library allowing applications to register
                             data for dumping

      3. minicoredumper_dbusd - a D-Bus service to allow multiple
                                applications to dump their data on demand
                                or if any of the applications crash

Installation
------------

    The minicoredumper package uses autotools:

      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ sudo make install

    In the "etc" directory there are sample configuration and D-Bus
    permission files.

    To inform Linux to use the minicoredumper for the core dump facility:

      $ echo '|/usr/local/bin/minicoredumper %p %u %g %s %t %h %e' | \
             sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

Demo
----

    This packages provides an example application to test the
    minicoredumper. The example application is not built by default.
    This must be activated with the --with-minicoredumper_demo
    argument for configure.

    The example application minicoredumper_demo uses libminicoredumper
    to register variables. If it is run with no command line arguments,
    it crashes deliberately, which should trigger the minicoredumper.
    The example also registers with minicoredumper_dbusd via D-Bus. When
    another registered application crashes, the example application will
    respond by dumping its data as well.

    The demo can be performed by running the example program twice. One
    instance that registers itself, waits, and exits gracefully, and
    another instance that crashes. Assuming minicoredumper is installed
    and activated, D-Bus is installed, and minicoredumper_dbusd is
    running, the demo can be executed with the following commands:

      $ minicoredumper_demo 6 & sleep 3 && minicoredumper_demo

    This will start one instance of minicoredumper_demo in the background
    that will gracefully exit after 6 seconds. After waiting 3 seconds,
    it also starts another instance of minicoredumper_demo in the
    foreground that will crash immediately.

    In the minicoredumper base_dir there should now be a directory
    containing a core file and the dump data from the second (crashed)
    instance of minicoredumper_demo. In that directory there should also
    be a subdirectory "dumps-NNN" containing the dump data from the
    first instance of minicoredumper_demo (that had a graceful exit).
