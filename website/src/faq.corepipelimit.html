Does the kernel parameter in <samp>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit</samp> require a certain value?
<p>This kernel parameter sets the maximum number of minicoredumper instances that can run simultaneously. For example, with a value of <samp>1</samp> and two programs crashing simultaneously, only one of programs will generate a core dump. The kernel uses a default value of <samp>0</samp>, which is a special value that allows unlimited simultaneous minicoredumper instances, but the kernel will not wait for the minicoredumper to exit before cleaning up the crashing program resources. More details about this parameter are available in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html">core</a>(5) manual page.</p>
<p>Because of how the minicoredumper works, the default value of <samp>0</samp> allows the core dumping to work correctly. However, it is recommended to set the maximum value <samp>0x7fffffff</samp> to be sure that it also works correctly for future kernel versions.</p>
