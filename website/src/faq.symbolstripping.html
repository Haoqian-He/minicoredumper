Will the minicoredumper work with stripped libraries and executables?
<p>There are some symbols that minicoredumper will need to find. These should not be stripped from their libraries and executables.
<ol>
<li>Any symbols specified as <samp>buffers</samp> in the recept file must not be stripped.</li>
<li>The folling symbols within the libminicoredumper library must not be stripped:
<ul>
<li>mcd_dump_data_version</li>
<li>mcd_dump_data_head</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although normally not needed, minicoredumper will fallback to manually check for some symbols in libpthread if the crashing application is using a libpthread that is incompatible with the libthread_db minicoredumper is using. Those libpthread symbols are:
<ul>
<li>_thread_db_sizeof_pthread</li>
<li>stack_used</li>
<li>__stack_user</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
