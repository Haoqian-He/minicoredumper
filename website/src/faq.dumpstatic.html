How can I configure minicoredumper to dump static data to the core file?
<p>Using the tool <samp>nm</samp> on the library or executable containing the symbol, it is possible to see the name of the symbol as used by the linker. This name can be specified as one of the <samp>buffers</samp> of a recept file.</p>
<p>As an alternative, if the application is using libminicoredumper, it can register specific data for dumping with <a href="$ROOT$man/man3/mcd_dump_data_register_bin.3.html">mcd_dump_data_register_bin()</a>.</p>
