    <h2>Dump Utility</h2>
    <p>The minicoredumper project provides a program that handles the creation of core dump files on Linux. It can produce much smaller core dump files by making use of sparse files, compression, and allowing the user to configure what parts of the process memory image should be dumped.</p>

    <h2>Live Dumps</h2>
    <p>The minicoredumper project optionally provides a D-Bus service and tool to trigger libminicoredumper applications to dump their registered data while running. If any of the applications should crash, that will trigger the others to dump their data as well.</p>
