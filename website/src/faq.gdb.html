Which features should be enabled so that gdb is satisfied?
<p>In general, a minimal recept file to satisfy gdb would look like this:</p>
<pre>
{
    "stacks": {
        "dump_stacks": true
    },
    "maps": {
        "dump_by_name": [
            "[vdso]"
        ]
    },
    "dump_auxv_so_list": true,
    "dump_pthread_list": true,
    "dump_robust_mutex_list": true
}
</pre>
<p>However, depending upon the application and what needs to be inspected, even some of these options may be disabled. See the <a href="$ROOT$man/man5/minicoredumper.recept.json.5.html">recept file man page</a> for details about each of these options.</p>
