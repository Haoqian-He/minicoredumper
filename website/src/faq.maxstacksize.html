If <samp>max_stack_size</samp> is configured and the limit is hit, what part of the stack is dumped?
<p>If a stack is truncated because of the <samp>max_stack_size</samp> option, the bottommost part of the used stack is dumped (i.e. the part of the stack that includes the function that caused the core dump).</p>
