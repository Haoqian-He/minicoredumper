Is D-Bus support necessary?
<p>D-Bus can be used by minicoredumper to trigger libminicoredumper-based applications to dump their data while running. If there will be no libminicoredumper-based applications running on the system or the trigger functionality is not needed, there is no reason to enable D-Bus support. D-Bus support can be disabled by providing <samp>--without-dbus</samp> as a command line argument when running the <samp>configure</samp> script.</p>
<p>Note: If D-Bus support is disabled, the trigger functionality is still available using a fallback mechanism based on inotify.</p>
