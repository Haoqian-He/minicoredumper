Is D-Bus support necessary?
<p>No. The current version of minicoredumper does not use D-Bus. Versions 1.x of the minicoredumper optionally used D-Bus for libminicoredumper dump notification, whereby libminicoredumper applications were responsible for dumping their own data upon notification. This mechanism has since been replaced. Now application dump data is extracted by the minicoredumper tool instead.</p>
